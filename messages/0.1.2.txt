=====================
CRITICAL UPDATE
=====================

My sincerest apologies but up to release 0.1.1 a subtle yet critical installation step  was not documented, which may have prevented you from using the plug-in altogether! 

You can find more information at https://github.com/mpourmpoulis/PythonVoiceCodingPlugin/issues/15 but release 0.1.2 should make that installation step redundant for most users, so SIMPLY UPGRADING  and replacing the grammar files should be enough without any further action on your part! 

In order to rapidly upgrade your grammars, if you are using Caster 1.x.x under
	
	Preferences > Package Settings  > PythonVoiceCodingPlugin

You will find

	Quick 1.0.0 Install

Many thanks to LexiconCode for pointing this massive blunder out and once again I am deeply sorry!
