PythonVoiceCodingPlugin

Release 0.0.5 he's out fixing problems of 0.0.4 regarding the installation via package control and adds a useful utilities under Preferences > Package Settings  > PythonVoiceCodingPlugin iincluding links to online documentation issues, grammar bundles and so on.

Code wise it is identical in its core with 0.0.4, which makes it almost 2 months old. However
I am currently wrapping up the development of 0.1.0. Also you should know that Caster 1.x.x is also supported but  you must enable it by saying


enable python voice coding plugin


 if you have any problem or questions regarding installation , whether of the plug-in itself or the grammar necessary to use it please let me know at my issues!
