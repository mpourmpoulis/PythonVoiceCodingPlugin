Thanks for downloading the latest 0.1.1 version of PythonVoiceCodingPlugin! 

Should you face any problems or have any questions regarding the installation process, feel free to contact me in the dedicated gitter channel

This link along with links to  the online documentation containing around 100 gifs with examples you can find under

	Preferences > Package Settings  > PythonVoiceCodingPlugin

From there you can also retrieve the Caster grammars that are necessary for using the plug-in along with instructions on how to install them. It supports all version of Caster 0.5, 0.6, 1.x but please upgrade as support for older versions will soon be dropped! As a note if you're using any version above 1.0.0 you must also enable it by saying

	enable python voice coding plugin

Finally you should be aware that there are some experimental/unofficial features you can manually enable!

NOTE FOR MAC Installers
#################################	

Honestly you caught me a little bit unprepared,I am releasing these for Windows and Linux so i didn't expect anyone to download on Mac:P Firstly the core plug-in has not been tested on Mac. Secondly currently the grammar is written to be used with Caster which does not yet officially support Mac, though https://github.com/dmakarov/Caster is an attempt to do so. So you might want to give it a try with that or adapt it to standalone dragonfly or what ever suits your system.
Finally if you are using Talon  and Jetbrains, an alternative you might want to check out is
