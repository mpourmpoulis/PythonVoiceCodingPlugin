Thanks for downloading the latest 0.1.3 version of PythonVoiceCodingPlugin! 

Should you face any problems or have any questions regarding the installation process, feel free to contact me in the dedicated gitter channel

	https://gitter.im/PythonVoiceCodingPlugin/community

This link along with links to  the online documentation containing around 100 gifs with examples you can find under

	Preferences > Package Settings  > PythonVoiceCodingPlugin

From there you can also retrieve the Caster grammars that are necessary for using the plug-in along with instructions on how to install them as well as a

	Quick 1.0.0 Install

utility. It supports all version of Caster 0.5, 0.6, 1.x but please upgrade as support for older versions will soon be dropped, most probably with release 0.2.0 when it comes out hopefully around mid August! As a note if you're using any version above 1.0.0 you must also enable it by saying

	enable python voice coding plugin


Finally you should be aware that there are some experimental/unofficial features you can manually enable!

NOTE FOR MAC Installers
#################################	

Honestly you caught me a little bit unprepared,I am releasing these for Windows and Linux so i didn't expect anyone to download on Mac  and lacking Mac hardware, the core plug-in has not been tested on Mac. Nonetheless it is pure python I believe it should generally work and with Caster now supporting Mac it is probably worth your while to give it a try!
