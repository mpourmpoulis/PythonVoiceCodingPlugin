# Grammar bundles

This folder contains my grammar and other related stuff

For the time being I only release bundles for Caster 0.5.11 and 0.6.11, these are in the Caster folder.

To install them simply copy paste the script insise caster "apps" folder:)

once again thanks to @LexiconCode there are bundles for the upcoming Caster 1.0.0 but installation is a bit different(to be updated)

For use within Linux see also the  Aenea folder

## Update

Also you should know that Caster 1.x.x is also supported but  you must enable it by saying

```
enable python voice coding plugin
```

also the datum needs to be stored in a different folder. Up until recently these used to be 

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.caster\rules
```

but the latest masterhas moved to this folder to

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\caster\rules
```
