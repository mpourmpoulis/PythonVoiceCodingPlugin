# Select Big Region of Interest Command

These commands are responsible for selecting "big" regions of interest. By "big" we refer to things like "if condition" or "assignment right" in contrast to say the first entry of a dictionary, though we will see later, by means of subindexes we can select [smaller stuff!](#SubIndexes)

In particular, the currently offered "big roiÂ´s" are :

```python
Choice("big_roi",{ 
"if condition" : "if condition", 
"else if condition" : "else if condition", 
"while condition" : "while condition", 

"if expression condition" : "if expression condition", 
"if expression body" : "if expression body", 
"if expression":"if expression",

"return value" : "return value", 

"pass":"pass", 
"break" : "break", 
"continue" : "continue", 

"assertion message" : "assertion message",
 "assertion condition" : "assertion condition", 
 
"(assignment right| right)" : "assignment right",
"(assignment left| left)" : "assignment left", 
"assignment full" : "assignment full",

 "import statement":"import statement", 

"(expression statement|expression)" : "expression statement", 

"iterator" : "iterator", "iterable" : "iterable",
 } ),
```

I hope most of them should be  self explanatory but you can find examples [below](#Selectable).

There are four syntaxes for this command:

```python 
"smart <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"

"[smart] <adjective> <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"

"[smart] <vertical_abstract_only_direction> [<ndir>] <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"

"[smart] <vertical_abstract_only_direction> [<ndir>] <block> [<adjective>] <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"
```

# Case one 

Ok lets start with the simple one, namely queries of the form: 

```python 
"smart <big_roi>"
``` 

As you might expect, the plugin will try to find matches to big roi description , prioritizing ones "nearer" in the AST with respect to the current selection.

t is also important to note that with exception of the import statements, all other queries search only within the current function.


# Case two 

another alternative are commands of the types:

```python 
"[smart] <adjective> <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"
```
you should probably be already familiar with adjectives, so here is an example of how you can use them:

![](./gif/big3.gif)

as with case one, only the current function searched. ( pay attention to my last example where alternatives are only offered from the nested function definition!)




# Case three 

Another alternative you can use is to provide information about the relative vertical position of your ROI with a command like that:

```python
"[smart] <vertical_abstract_only_direction> [<ndir>] <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"
```
The only difference compared to argument selection is that you can only use the more "abstract", 'above' and 'below' keywords:

```python 
Choice("vertical_abstract_only_direction",{ 
	"above":"above",
 	"below":"below", 
 } ),
```
As an example:

![](./gif/big4.gif)

Another important detail is that these types of queries are not limited to searching only the current function like the adjective ones! 

![](./gif/big11.gif)


# Case four 

Ok this is a bit different:)
This variant combines vertical and positional order information. 

```python
"[smart] <vertical_abstract_only_direction> [<ndir>] <block> [<adjective>] <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"
```
What on earth is that "block" thing over there? Well for the time being there is only one option available:

```python 
Choice("block",{ 
		"(function|functions)" :"function",
	 } 
),
```

So essentially, we can specify a function using a relative vertical desciption with the above/below keywords!

```python 
"<vertical_abstract_only_direction> [<ndir>] <block>"
```


Once we have established which function we are to search, the command will then work more or less like cases one and two

```python
"[<adjective>] <big_roi> [<big_roi_sub_index>]"
```

 but will search inside that function!

# Selectable


### Assignment And Expression Statements

probably one of the most basic examples and one of the most frequently used ones as well

```python
"(assignment right| right)" : "assignment right",
"(assignment left| left)" : "assignment left",
"assignment [full]" : "assignment full",
"(expression statement|expression)" : "expression statement",
```

![](./gif/big20.gif)

A small example with sub indexing is also included:)

### If conditions While loops With clauses

```python
"if condition" : "if condition",
"else if condition" : "else if condition",
"while condition" : "while condition",
"with item" : "with clause",
```

![](./gif/big21.gif)


### If expressions

```python
"if expression":"if expression",
"if expression condition" : "if expression condition",
"if expression body" : "if expression body",
"if expression else" : "if expression else",
```

![](./gif/big22.gif)

### Iterator  and Iterable

```python
"iterator" : "iterator",
"iterable" : "iterable",
```
![](./gif/big23.gif)

### Comprehensions

```python
"comprehension condition" : "comprehension condition",
"comprehension value" : "comprehension value",
```
![](./gif/big24.gif)

### Exception Handling

```python
"exception":"exception",
"exception name":"exception name",
"handler":"handler",
```

![](./gif/big25.gif)

Please note that empty handlers are supported as well and that some examples with some indexing are included.

### Assertions And Exceptions Raising

```python
"assertion message" : "assertion message",
"assertion condition" : "assertion condition",

"exception raised" : "exception raised",
"raised cause": "raised cause",
```

### Functional Definitions

### Class Definitions

```python
"class name": "class name",
"decorator":"decorator",
"base class":"base class",
```

![](./gif/big28.gif)

### Import 

```python
"import statement":"import statement",
"import value" : "import value",
"module" : "import module",
```

# SubIndexes

So far we have seen cases where we can select an entire region of interest.
However,there are cases where you are interested in only a portion of this whole ROI. For instance there may be multiple targets in the left hand of an assignment and you want to select only one of them. Or your function may return multiple values. or your right hand side contains a dictionary and you want a specific key-value pair. In those cases the 

```python 
IntegerRefST("big_roi_sub_index",0,10),
```
comes in useful:


![](./gif/big2.gif)

Okay , can we do something similar for other cases? like select only a portion of an if condition?

![](./gif/big6.gif)

As illustrated above, you need to pay attention to how the various conditions are bound together
(or binds weaker causing it to be higher in the AST) in the can only select smaller conditions  from the outermost level!

This feature existed ever since the initial release but was only documented on 0.0.1 . This release also expanded the feature from applying only to ast.BoolOp nodes to encompass ast.Compare nodes as well! in plain English:

![](./gif/big7.gif)  

furthermore, big_roi_sub_index can make our lives easier even in cases like the one below:

![](./gif/big8.gif)  

where we want to play with the indexes of a subscript!

### new with 0.0.4

Sub indexing functionality has been expanded to include picking up parts of strings :

![](./gif/big10.gif)  

We can pick up parts from the URL, individual words or letters, or part of a camel or snake case. this feature is still immatur  and needs more work, but I am planning to improve and also expand it with the ability to select a whole range.

Also something that was kind of missing,you can now select a subset of an arithmetic expression :

![](./gif/big12.gif)  

Once again you need to pay attention to operator precedence and as you can see there are some edge cases that need to be fixed.

Finally, we clarify one more thing! What about relative vertical offsets when using above? We know that these abstract vertical keywords only count interesting lines, but what do we count as interesting here? To stay compatible with all of the above, we count all lines containing our desired big region of interest regardless of whether we can extract or not from them information with the sub index! As an example:

![](./gif/big9.gif)  


please note however that there are limitations  and sub indexes are more of a solution to make the simplest case faster
rather than a systematic way of handling complex code!
